### Keywords 

- **IBM Jazz Repository** - To deeper understand the current state of software tagging in real-world practice and ultimately build an efficient automatic tag recommendation tool, we conducted an empirical study on IBM Jazz’s repository, which contains the data for their software development for more than three years.

- **Tagging** - tagging is a lightweight yet very useful mechanism in helping in developers’ communication and bridging the gap between social and technical aspects [2]. It provides a simple way for annotations in which a developer could tag his artifacts so that others could search and find them. 
- **Correlation** - Correlation is any of a broad class of statistical relationships involving dependence, though in common usage it most often refers to the extent to which two variables have a linear relationship with each other.
- **Fuzzy Set Theory** - Fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a membership function valued in the real unit interval [0, 1].

### Notes

- **Study instruments** - Use of IBM Jazz’s repository to get data and tag more desired information.

- **Informative visualizations** -

- **Related work** - Despite the popularity of automatic tagging tools in Web environment and social computing technologies, there has not been many such tools in software development. TagSEA (Tags for Software Engineering Actitivies) supports social tagging and communication among developers via tags and user-defined navigational structures [10], [11]. Other types of tools supporting for tagging in source code include GNU Global [12], social bookmarking in Code Snipets [13], Byte- Mycode [14]. Unlike our tool, these tools focus on source code and have limited supports for other types of software artifacts. Poshyvanyk et al.  [15] use Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI).

- **New results** - The empirical evaluation on the real-world IBM Jazz project shows that TagRec is time efficient and well-suitable for interactive uses in daily development. Importantly, it is very accurate with high recall (76%) and precision (50%). 

### Needs Improvement

- By analyzing formal information the informal semantics contained in the vocabulary of source code are overlooked. To understand software as a whole, we need to enrich software analysis with the developer knowledge hidden in the code naming
- Program analysis is the process of automatically analyzing the behavior of computer programs regarding a property such as correctness, robustness, safety and liveness. We can make use of program analysis to enrich the semantic relations between source code and work-items
