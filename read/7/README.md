Towards Discovering the Role of Emotions in Stack Overflow

### Keywords 

- **Sentiment Analysis** - Sentiment analysis involves classifying opinions in text into categories like "positive" or "negative" often with an implicit category of "neutral".

- **Experimental Design** - Experimental design is the process of planning a study to meet specified objectives. Planning an experiment properly is very important in order to ensure that the right type of data and a sufficient sample size and power are available to answer the research questions of interest as clearly and efficiently as possible. 

- **Technical Forum (e.g. Stack Overflow)** -  A Technical forum, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations about various technical issues/questions in the form of posted messages. These questions are often answered by members of the same community.

- **Social Learning** - It is a method of participating with others to make sense of new ideas. Sharing thoughts on stack overflow is a good example of social learning.

### Notes

- **Study Instruments** - Pubic data dump from Stack Overflow was used in the study. This includes all the questions, answers, votes and tags between 2008 to 2014. This data contains:<br>
  a. 7,214,802 questions with 58% having accepted answers.<br>
  b. 12,609,623 answers and 36,923 tags.<br>

- **Pattern** - These were the attributes of recognized answers
1. Consise code
2. Using question context
3. Highlighting important elements
4. Step-by-step solution
5. Providing links to extra resources

- **Related work** - 
1. Study for sentiments in Github commits performed by Guzman et al. shows evidence of correlation of negative sentiment with commit activity performed on Monday in 29 GitHub projects.
2. Mitra and Gilbert present a study on the cognitive and affective style of communication that happen on the Kickstarter platform in order to predict the success of crowdfunding requests.

- **Future Work** - Findings were made that code examples and explanations are inseparable elements of recognized answers. Using these findings the author looks forward to combining the findings on automated tests and study their effects on developers learning experinece


### Needs Improvement

- Authors criteria for building our sample might be regarded as too restrictive (focusing on Java Q&A and using threads containing code examples with relatively high score). There might be a lot of recognized answers without code, but would barely provide much insight into reaching our goal.
- Another limiting assumption of their study was the score of answers. They assumed that answers with higher scores generally mean better solutions; however, other factors such as answer posting time, the question topic, and the responder identity might affect these numbers.
- The generalizability of our findings could be regarded as another limitation.
