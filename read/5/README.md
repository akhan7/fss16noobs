### Team D

### Reference
What makes a good coding example? A study of programming Q&A in StackOverflow

### Keywords 

- **Code Example** - This specifies what kind of code is actually helpful to developers and maintainers to solve problems and which are not helpful to them.

- **Documentation** - This specifies that the documentation of the code in stack overflow answer is as important as the code itself.

- **API** -  Application program interface is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact and APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.

- **Social Learning** - It is a method of participating with others to make sense of new ideas. Sharing thoughts on stack overflow is a good example of social learning

### Notes

- **Study Instruments** - Data collected was from stack overflow. The code example selected was from the Q&A thread that <br>
  a. Contains an answer with relatively high score.<br>
  b. Answer should contain a code<br>
  Crawling done on 150000 pages and resulted in 497 pages with that attribute

- **Pattern** - These were the attributes of recognize

- **Informative visualizations**

- **Future Work** - This is a collaborative way of tagging. In future its expected that the sites will continue to provide fertile ground for studying computer mediated collaborative systems and these will further help in automate the process of tagging on the basis of user behaviour


### Needs Improvement

- This is a manual way of tagging. The data provided shows how the trends of a user tagging with a particular keyword increases with number of bookmarks and there is a pattern followed. 
- This pattern can therefore be used to automatically tag some context with some machine learning paradigm. There are various kinds of tags and this information can be used for categorization.
- Tags themselves vary in frequency of use, as well as in what they describe. This paper was focused on the findings from Delicious, however which might only be a case with users using delicious. Findings need to be on a more diversed platform and on diverse set of data.
